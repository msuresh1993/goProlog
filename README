CSE 505 : Computing With Logic 
HW 4: Aggregation and Tabled Evaluation
----------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN
-----------
[go].
go(filename). 	%filename is the .pd file contatining the DP written by the user
				%currently available: shortestpath, lcs, editdist

Examples:
[go].

go(shortestpath).
shortestpath(1,2,Q,W).

go(editdist).
editdist(['b','b','c','d','e'],['b','c','d','e','e'],D,E).

go(lcs).
lcs(['a','b','c','d'],['a','b','d','e'],L,S).


CONTENTS
--------

1. Begin:
	go.P
	% Compiles and loads interpreter.P and the program 'filename' when you run go(filename).

2. Translator:
	interpreter.P
	% Generates a .P file understandable by XSB from the the .pd file written by the user
	% Example -It generates shortestpath_build.P from shortestpath.pd 

3. Helper file:
	helper.P 
	% Contains a few helper predicates required by the interpreter and the user program

4. Example Dynamic Programing Problems - written at a higher level of abstraction by the user:
	Shortest Path: 				shortestpath.pd 
	Longest Common Subsequence: lcs.pd
	Edit Distance: 				editdist.pd
    
5. README  

6. Generated .P files
	**These files will not be generated until you run go(filename)**
	shortestpath_build.P
	lcs_build.P
	editdist_build.P
